# The Odin Project
This repo contains all the coursework from TOP in relation to the Full Stack Node JS path.

The Odin Project is one of those "What I wish I had when I was learning" resources. Not everyone has access to a computer science education or the funds to attend an intensive coding school and neither of those is right for everyone anyway. This project is designed to fill in the gap for people who are trying to hack it on their own but still want a high quality education.

# Origin of The Odin Project

The Odin Project provides a free open source coding curriculum that can be taken entirely online. Since itâ€™s inception, it has helped many students get hired as developers and has assisted countless others learn enough programming to work on their own personal projects.

Founded in 2013 by Erik Trautman, The Odin Project is now sponsored by Thinkful, a new type of technology school that provides 1-on-1 learning through its network of industry experts, hiring partners, and online platform to deliver a structured and flexible education. The Odin Project is maintained and continually improved by a team of volunteers, many of whom learned to code with us.
